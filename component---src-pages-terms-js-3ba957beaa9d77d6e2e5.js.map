Scope of Service</h3>\n            <h4>Details of the works</h4>\n            <p>We will create a master document outlining every functionality / funnels to be improved of your App. The contract will include\n            one main design plus the opportunity for you to make up to two rounds of revisions. If you're not\n            happy with the designs at this stage, you will pay us in full for all of the work that we have\n            produced until that point and you may either cancel the contract or continue to commission us at\n            an additional fee.</p>\n            <p>We will also look at the visual design and branding of the App. If you would like us to create a visual identity for\n            your company (logo, color scheme, font, stationary, business card design, etc.) or make design changes for a specific part we will do so at this stage. Doing so will increase the fees owed to convy.io/uxpages by an amount we will agree upon\n            should you choose to take this route.</p>\n            <p>convy.io/uxpages offers services (the Service) which includes the following:</p>\n            <p>2.1 Consulting. We deliver UI review (from a front-end and usability perspective and from a conversion rate perspective) and analytics reports. Consulting activities deliverables include the following : PET Checklist, Front-end Checklist, Affordance Analysis, Quick Wins to Reach Your KPIs, User Testing Guides, Conversion Checklist, Form Analysis, Responsive Report, Funnel Definition, Optimization Plan, Heuristic Evaluation, SWOT Analysis, UI Benchmark, a/b Test Setup, Field Study &amp; User Interview, Behaviour Analysis, Cognitive Ergonomics, UX Value Proposition, Product Strategy &amp; Concept Testing, Fully Coded Prototype, Inputs from Industry Experts, Predictive Analysis. Logistics costs for user interview or testing sessions (including convy.io/uxpages consultants travel expenses) will be charged to the customer</p>\n            <p> 2.1 HTML, CSS and Javascript. We deliver templates (Fully Coded Prototype or final optimized design) developed from HTML5 markup, CSS3 stylesheets for styling and Javascript for poly-fills and behaviours.</p>\n            <p>2.3 a/b testing. We deliver a/b testing in PHP or RoR languages. Quick wins testing might be implemented using Google optimize tools. Please refer to our privacy policy for data details.</p>\n            <p>2.4 Browser testing. Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of\n            different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean that convy.io/uxpages will ensure that a user’s\n            experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.</p>\n            <p>2.5 Desktop browser testing. convy.io/uxpages test the work to be delivered in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We’ll also\n            test to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 for Windows users get an appropriate, possibly\n            different, experience. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>\n            <p>2.6 Mobile browser testing. Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We test our work in:\n            iOS up to v6: Safari, Google Chrome and Opera Mini\n            Android 5, 6, 7, 8 : Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera Mini. We currently don’t test Blackberry OS or Blackberry QNX, Opera Mobile, Symbian or other Android \n            mobile browsers under v4. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>\n            <p>2.7 Technical support. convy.io/uxpages is not a website hosting company but we will use OVH servers if we agree to implement integrated a/b testing on our servers. This setup will include Google Analytics and Google Optimize. Once the testing phase finalizes, the content will be removed and removal evidences will be provided to the customer. convy.io/uxpages will offer Technical Support for this Service via OVH support desk. For any issue relating to the Service, Customer may contact convy.io/uxpages’s technical support by sending an email to hello@convy.io. Only Customer or Customer’s authorized user may contact convy.io/uxpages’s technical support. If the a/b testing or any improvement is hosted by client, convy.io/uxpages will not provide any technical support related to hosting.</p>\n            <h3>3. Out-of-scope and Change Orders</h3>\n            <p>3.1 We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit\n            you to your earliest ideas. We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at\n            the beginning is based on the length of time we estimate we’ll need to accomplish\n            everything you’ve told us you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to\n            change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate\n            estimate for that.</p>\n            <p>3.2 The prices at the beginning of this document are based on the number of days that we estimate\n            we'll need to accomplish everything that you have told us you want to achieve.
